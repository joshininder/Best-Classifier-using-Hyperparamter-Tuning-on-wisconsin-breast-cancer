# Best-Classifier-using-Hyperparamter-Tuning-on-wisconsin-breast-cancer
This project is made for the educational purpose. In this project, different classifier are used to diagnosis breast cancer. Hyperparameter tuning is used for optimising the hyperparameters to yield optimum result. I have used wisconsin breadt cancer dataset.
